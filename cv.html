            <p>As a recent graduate of Osmaniye Korkut Ata Üniversitesi with a Licentiate degree in General Studies, I have a strong foundation in management information systems and web development. I have acquired skills in C#, MsSQL, HTML5, and CSS, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools. 

               <p> I have worked on multiple web development projects, both as a freelancer and as a member of OKÜ IARES, a student club focused on renewable energy. </p>
                <p>I have also gained valuable experience as a <strong>Structurer at Akkuyu Nükleer</strong>, where I applied my web development skills to support the design and implementation of nuclear power plant projects. </p>
                I am more proficient in back end development, but I have also dabbled in front end development. My goal is to leverage my web development expertise and my structuring experience to create innovative and impactful solutions for complex problems.</p>
